# Pomodoro
Pomodoro GUI app built using Python Tkinter module.

This program emulates a count down and follows the Pomodoro technique, that is :

25 minutes of work  
5 minutes of break

After alternating the above 4 times, the user gets a 20 minutes long break.

Once a phase of working or a break is done, the window will pop in on the desktop and the next phase (work or break) will start.

To run this program simply put the main.py as well as the tomato image in the same directory and run the main.py file.
